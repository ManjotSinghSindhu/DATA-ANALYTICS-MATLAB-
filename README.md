# DATA-ANALYTICS-MATLAB-
MATLAB is a high- performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming environment. Furthermore, MATLAB is a modern programming language environment: it has sophisticated data structures, contains built-in editing and debugging tools, and supports object-oriented programming.

ADVANTAGES OF MATLAB:
1. Easy to use.
2. Platform Independence.
3. Predefined Functions.
4. Device- Independent Plotting.
5. Graphical User Interface.
6. MATLAB Compiler.

DISADVANTAGES OF MATLAB:
1. MATLAB is based on an interpreted language and it may execute slower than compiled programs.
2. A full copy of MATLAB is 5 to 10 times more expensive than a C/C++/Fortran compiler.

THE M FILES
MATLAB allows writing two kinds of program files âˆ’
1. SCRIPTS: 
Script files are program files with .m extension. In these files, you write series of commands, which you want to execute together. Scripts do not accept inputs and do not return any outputs. They operate on data in the workspace.
2. FUNCTIONS: 
Functions files are also program files with .m extension. Functions can accept inputs and return outputs. Internal variables are local to the function.
